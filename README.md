# Sales_Analysis_Project

## Objective
As a data analyst for Adventure Works company, I was tasked with creating a comprehensive report using SQL and PowerBI. The report aims to extract valuable insights from the provided dataset, which includes information about calendar dates, customers, products, Sales, and Budget.

## Project Goals
Design a comprehensive dashboard to monitor key performance indicators (KPIs) related to internet sales. This dashboard should provide a clear overview of sales, budget, and profit. Additionally, it should enable better tracking of top-performing customers and products.

Create a detailed report on sales categorized by customers, allowing easy identification of the most valuable customers and potential new sales opportunities.
Generate a detailed report on sales categorized by products, facilitating identification of the best-selling products.

Develop a sales tracking dashboard that provides an overview of internet sales over time, allowing easy comparison against the budget. 

## Methodology
I utilized SQL server queries to efficiently extract, transform, and cleanse the data. Once the data was prepared, I seamlessly imported it into CSV files. For the subsequent ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes, I leveraged Power Query, enabling streamlined data transformations.

Created a detailed overview of sales categorized by products. This analysis will reveal product-level trends and forecasts, allowing the company to focus on the best-selling products. Moreover, it will help compare regional performance, providing insights to enhance sales and improve decision-making.
